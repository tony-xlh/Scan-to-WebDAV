# Scan to WebDAV

Scan documents with [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview/) and save them to a WebDAV server.

Due to CORS, a Python server is used to receive documents from a web page and then upload the documents to a WebDAV server.

## About WebDAV

WebDAV stands for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning. It is an HTTP extension that makes it easy to create, read, and edit files hosted on remote Web servers.

Many http server or file sync and share applications support this protocal like Apache, lighttpd and Nextcloud.
